Punchcard: A project time tracker

A Django app that lets you track hours worked on projects. Work units are input
as entries, and each entry belongs to an entry category. Entry categories can
be subcategories of other entry categories, nested as deep as you want.

Working and useful, but only used by me, so only the bare minimum of features
are implemented. The interface is useful but not pretty. Currently everything
is site-wide, no support for users.
